# Augmented Reality (AR) Basics

## Project Overview

This project aims to help you understand some fundamental concepts in Augmented Reality (AR) development. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without the need for external help.

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is ARKit?

ARKit is a software development kit (SDK) provided by Apple for creating augmented reality experiences on iOS devices.

### 2. What is ARCore?

ARCore is Google's platform for building augmented reality experiences on Android devices.

### 3. What is ARFoundation?

ARFoundation is a cross-platform AR development framework provided by Unity. It allows developers to create AR applications that can run on both iOS and Android using a unified codebase.

### 4. How does plane detection work?

Plane detection is the process of identifying flat surfaces (like tables or floors) in the physical environment through the device's camera. This allows virtual objects to interact realistically with the real world.

### 5. How to detect planes using AR Foundation?

Using AR Foundation, you can use functions and methods provided by the framework to identify and track flat surfaces in the environment.

### 6. How to publish applications for both Android and iOS with Unityâ€™s AR Foundation?

Once you've created your AR application using Unity and AR Foundation, you can export and publish it separately for Android and iOS platforms using the respective build settings.

### 7. How to create responsive UI for mobile devices?

To create a user interface (UI) that adapts well to different mobile devices, you can use Unity's UI components and design principles like anchors and flexible layouts.

### 8. How to design in an augmented reality space?

Designing in augmented reality involves placing virtual objects in the real world so they appear natural and interact with the environment convincingly.

### 9. What does SLAM stand for and what does it mean?

SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. It's a technology used in AR to map and understand the environment in real time while also keeping track of the device's position.

For more in-depth information, you can refer to official documentation and tutorials provided by Apple, Google, Unity, and other AR development communities.

Happy AR development!
